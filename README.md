- TestFiles130 = 1Fixed-NetworkAnnotation
    - Removed large sample from the set so that it's more portable
    - Removed everything past ..046_10312
    - I think it was run at 30%

- Trimmed even more files (removed everything past and including ...1043_09386
    - 1834 images 
        - 3522 total items (excluding data):
        - 3522 - 1834 = 1688 xmls, 146 unannotated images
        
        
- The program doesn't work with files that were pushed through labelimg (it changes the XML)
- TestFiles5 = 20181112505
    - There are 2067 total files excluding data and emptyrgb.png
    

- Updated Confidence plotter to export a file confidences.csv which contains the non-redundant percentages 
    of confidences which MovingAveragePlotter can use directly
